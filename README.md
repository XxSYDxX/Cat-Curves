# CatCurves
 A python program to plot a symstem of equations of a typical cat which is definitely not a cat.
 I defined a system of equations as a token of my love and respect for cats.
 Then I plotted the equations using matplotlib on a graph.

 If you are okay with au naturale "cats" run `python main.py` inside the directory.

# Requirements:
 Python packages "matplotlib" & "numpy" must be installed.
